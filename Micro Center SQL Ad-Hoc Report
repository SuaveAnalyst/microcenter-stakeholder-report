üîç Summary of Key Findings

1Ô∏è.) Price & Promotion Effects
- Products featured on the main page accounted for 52.91% of total sales, despite being a smaller portion of the dataset.
- This suggests that homepage promotion has a measurable impact on weekly sales performance.

2Ô∏è.) Vendor & SKU Performance
- Vendor 8 consistently ranks #1 in average weekly sales (197.24 units).
- Vendors 2 and 4 also perform strongly, while vendors 7 and 1 show significantly lower performance.

3Ô∏è.) Product Functionality Insights
- Mobile phone accessories generated the highest total revenue (~1.79M), followed by fitness trackers (~1.29M) and selfie sticks (~1.06M).
- The lowest revenue came from Bluetooth trackers and headphones.
- These insights highlight which product categories are most financially impactful.
