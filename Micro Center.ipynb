# ## Strategic Optimization Plan ‚Äì Backed by Data

# %% [markdown]
# **üí°Insight**: February is the weakest sales month (17k), followed by April and December.
# 
# Recommendation:
# 
# *   Use demand forecasting to reduce overstock risk during these periods. 
# *   Focus on lean inventory strategies and use promo testing to   determine if these slumps can be lifted cost-effectively.

# %% [markdown]
# **üí°Insight**: June and September are the highest grossing months (43k each), with clear spikes in weekly sales during weeks 24‚Äì26 and 37‚Äì38.
# 
# Recommendation:
# 
# *   Focus marketing and inventory efforts around late Q2 and early Q3. Launch seasonal bundles or flash sales timed with these periods to maximize ROI on high-traffic windows.
# 
# 

# %% [markdown]
# **üí°Insight**: Visuals show an inverse relationship between price and sales ‚Äî lower prices frequently align with sales spikes.
# 
# Recommendation:
# 
# *   Implement price elasticity modeling per SKU and test strategic markdowns during shoulder seasons (e.g., February, April, November) to smooth out low-demand dips without cutting into high-margin periods.
