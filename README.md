# Project Background
Micro Center, founded in 1979, is a U.S.-based electronics retailer known for its wide selection of computer hardware and consumer electronics. While the company has maintained strong in-store sales, rising competition from online-first retailers like Amazon and Newegg has pressured Micro Center to extract more value from its internal sales data to remain competitive in the evolving retail landscape.

With large volumes of historical sales data at the weekly SKU level, this project aims to uncover key performance insights that can support smarter pricing, promotion, and vendor strategies. Micro Center’s leadership has tasked the team with analyzing trends and identifying actionable insights. Micro Center has provided a limited dataset to evaluate the team's ability to generate actionable insights. If the initial findings demonstrate potential for a positive return on investment, a proposal for continued collaboration and expanded analysis will be considered.


Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

  * Sales Trends Analysis: Identifying historical weekly sales patterns and revenue changes across time to uncover seasonality, sales dips, or growth windows.

  * Price & Promotion Effects: Measuring how featured placements and price shifts affect weekly performance at the product level.

  * Vendor & SKU Performance: Highlighting which vendors consistently deliver high-performing products — and which may be underperforming.

  * Product Functionality Insights: Understanding which categories (e.g., mobile accessories, PC parts) drive the most volume and revenue.

  * Optimization Opportunities: Offering strategic next steps to improve revenue, pricing, or promotional efficiency.
